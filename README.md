Code for the Q-website
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

###Versioning for the Q-website.

Since the qwebsite is going to be hosted in an oldish machine in peril of dying
at anytime we have kept the code simple, that is, [pure](http://purecss.io/ "Pure.io") css3 and html5, and a
very small javascript file part of the boilerplate.

For now the test website is hosted at:

http://qdyn.no-ip.org/
