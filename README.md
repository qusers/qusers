Code for the Q-website
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Versioning for the Q-website.  

Since the qwebsite is going to be hosted in an oldish machine in peril of dying
at anytime we have kept the code simple, that is, pure css3 and html5, and a
very small javascript file part of the [pure](http://purecss.io/ "Pure.io") boilerplate.

For now the test website is hosted at:

http://qdyn.no-ip.org/
