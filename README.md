Code for the Q-website
================================================================================

### Versioning for the Q-website.  

The **Q** website, which had been hosted at the URL: <http://xray.bmc.uu.se/~aqwww/q/> 
can no longer be reached there.

Luckily a transition to the simplest possible boilerplate had already been done a 
while back and the only practicality missing was to deploy using github's generous
page hosting and automated jekyll integration.

So, the code for the website is pure css3 and html5, and a
very small javascript file part of the [pure](https://purecss.io/ "Pure.io") boilerplate.

The website continues to be hosted at:

http://qdyn.no-ip.org/

But will probably soon be redirected to:

https://qusers.github.io

Maybe at some point someone will donate some bucks to get a nicer domain.
