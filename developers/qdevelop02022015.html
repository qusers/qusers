# 1. next meeting

Monday, February 16, 3:00 - 3:30. Then split into groups, specially to
take care  of cleaning the  multiple branches  and leave one  dev, and
another 5.7 stable branch.

I think we can  reduce the meeting to those doing the coding, so, the
bosses can be informed  but it's a bit of a waste  of their time until
we make  it to  the 5.8  Milestone. So, I'll  stop e-mailing  them for
now. In practice that's how it worked today.

Coderz = Alex, Beat, Irek, Masoud, Mauricio, Miha, Paul

As today was quite disorganized I think  we need always to have a meet
and greet  moderator who is  prepared with an  agenda, or we  can also
define a  fixed agenda  for next  meetings and  still have  a prepared
moderator. 

---

Please make suggestions. It would help a lot to get feedback on how to
keep it as "short-and-sweet" as possible.

I propose the following:

A. Five minute chat of what we have worked on, or seen a new cool trick
   for fortran, or a weird bug,  or anything at all to report regarding
   coding and Q.  To keep it short (as we need to  concentrate on more
   pressing results for our bosses) I propose that only three of us per
   meeting will give  these chats. I think we can  start with the order
   in the coderz list, that is, in  two weeks Alex, Beat and Irek give
   a five  minute, informal chat(very  very "ta det lugnt"),  then the
   next three and so on.

B. Then the moderator spends the next fifteen minutes on breaking down
   where we are at,  and where we need to go.  Suggestions on who does
   the moderator  job are  open. Should  we just  rotate it  every two
   weeks?, or pick a set of  us to moderate? Or democratically elect a
   moderator/benevolent dictator?

C. All work and no play makes jack a dull boy.  I promise to have
   cookies and coffee/tea available next time.

# 2. code standards

    2.1. Agreed two spaces instead of tabs.

    2.2. Needed clean test set - known results reproducibility

    2.3. benchmark set - test for speed

        2.3.1. serial

        2.3.2. parallel

---

## 2.2. test set

- water sphere alone

- water sphere plus ions

- alanine dipeptide  and tripeptide (typical  conformational stability
  test. Ramachandran plot.)

- existing one - anyone know what this ligand is?

- n-butane (FEP comparison Beglov-Roux 1994)

- 2,4-quinazolinediamine - not specially  significant apart from being
  the Q-logo molecule and one  of the first explored antimalarial DHFR
  inhibitors.

- DHFR

---

# 3. Intended updates

- Alex wants to get busy on implementing LINC and/or RATTLE

- Christopher, Mauricio  and GPCR  peeps volunteered dictatorially by
  Mauricio to help bring up to date the qtutorials.


---

# 4. q-website / q-webserver

http://xray.bmc.uu.se/~aqwww/q

http://qwebsite.no-ip.org/

Mauricio will  take care  of getting an  icm name for  it and  a fixed
IP. The box  is ready and configured  with Fedora 21. I  think this is
important. Specially  for   offering   password  restricted   stable
binaries and looking decent online. As soon as it's set-up I'll create
accounts for all.
