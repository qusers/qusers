            <p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation can be used to
                sample the thermally accessible region of conformational space of a
                microscopic model of a molecular system. From the ensemble of sampled
                structures and their associated potential energies (given by the force
                field or molecular mechanics potential energy function) it is, in
                principle, possible to calculate free energies. Quantities such as
                binding free energies, solvation free energies and activation free
                energies are particularly interesting to calculate because they are
                the direct result of thermodynamic or kinetic experiments. It is thus
                possible both to quantitatively verify calculated results against
                experimental data and to make predictions which can be tested
                experimentally. Q is a set of tools for such calculations, tailored
                for some specific kinds of free energy calculations, namely:
            <ul>
                <li>(I) Free energy perturbation (FEP) simulations.</li>
                <li>(II) Empirical valence bond (EVB) calculations of reaction free energies.</li>
                <li>(III) Linear interaction energy (LIE) calculations of receptor-ligand binding
                    affinities.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The main features which distinguish Q from other MD packages are:</p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead"><span id="documentation">Documentation</span></h2>

            <p>The Q manual is only available on-line as a PDF file. You need
                Acrobat Reader from Adobe to view and maybe print out your own
                copy.</p>
<ul>
            <li><a href="documents/qman5.pdf">Q version 5 manual in PDF format</a></li>
</ul>
            The latest changes are briefly documented in the version history files:
            Qdyn version history
            Qprep version history
            Qcalc version history
            Qfep version history

            <h2 class="content-subhead"><span id="evaluation">Evaluation Version</span></h2>

            <p>If you want to try Q before requesting a license, we provide an
                evaluation kit. The kit contains executable images for the Q programs
                for the Win32/Intel x86 platform (i.e. Windows95, Windows98, WindowsNT
                running on Pentium-like processors). The evaluation programs were
                built with all compiler optimisations disabled and therefore run at
                less than 20% of the speed of the optimised programs. Only Gromos87
                force field files are included in the kit.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Download evaluation kit for windows</li>
                <li>Download evaluation kit for linux</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To get started in setting up your own test simulations, you
                probably want to look at the Q examples avalilable on-line.</p>

            <p>We are working on a licencing scheme for commercial users, involving a
                license fee. Please send inquiries to Johan Åqvist, introducing
                yourself and your company. The evaluation version is of course
                available also to prospective commercial users.</p>

            <p>We have no resources to support users of Q, but of course we
                appreciate a dialogue with you as a user. Particularly, we are anxious
                to hear from you in the (hopefully unlikely?) case that you discover a
                bug in the program. If time permits, we may also be able to answer
                other questions, e.g. about using the program, simulation procedures
                or compilation. If you have questions about Q regarding licenses,
                send these directly to Johan Åqvist. Bug reports and other questions
                should be sent to Christopher Lind.</p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead"><span id="mailinglist">Q-user mailing list</span></h2>

            <p>The Q-users mailing list is hosted at google-groups. To be included
